<p><em>Network Infrastructure</em> is an interconnected group of computer systems linked by the various parts of a telecommunicationsarchitecture. Specifically, this infrastructure refers to the organization of its various parts and their configuration from individual networked computers to routers, cables, wireless, access points, switches, backbones, network protocols, and network access methodologies. Infrastructures can be either <em>open</em> or <em>closed</em>, such as the open architecture of the Internet or the closed architecture of a private <em>intranet</em>. They can operate over wired or wireless network connections, or a combination of both. Other that Network's Infrastructure includes the physical hardware used to transmit data electronically such as routers, switches, gateways, bridges, and hubs.</p>
<p><em>Unified Threat Management (UTM)</em> is a comprehensive solution that has recently emerged in the network security industry, and since 2004 it has gained widespread currency as a primary network gateway defense solution for organizations. In theory, UTM is the evolution of the traditional firewall into an all-inclusive security product able to perform multiple security functions within one single appliance: network firewalling, network intrusion prevention and gateway antivirus (AV), gateway anti-spam, VPN, content filtering, load balancing,  data leak prevention and on-appliance reporting.</p>
