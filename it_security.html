<title>IT Security Risk Intelligence</title>
</head>

<body>
<p><em>Security Intelligence</em> is the real-time collection, normalization, and analysis of the data generated by users, applications and infrastructure that impacts the IT security and risk posture of an enterprise. The goal of Security Intelligence is to provide actionable and comprehensive insight that reduces risk and operational effort for any size organization.</p>
<p>The ongoing struggle to prevent hackers from breaching assets and malware from gaining a foothold requires a vulnerability management strategy that begins with a comprehensive measurement of <em>security risk</em>. Organizations must examine the entire IT stack, including the operating system, network, applications, and databases. The cycle of discovering assets, capturing and processing vulnerability data, identifying actual risks, testing and prioritizing mitigation tasks, and verifying effective controls grows more complex with every new technology that adds convenience but multiplies risk of a breach or incident. These new technologies include dynamic, virtualized environments and services outside traditional physical IT infrastructures, such as virtualized, cloud-based services and social networking.</p>
